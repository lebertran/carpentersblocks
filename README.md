# Carpenter's Blocks
An attempt to port Mineshopper's Carpenter's Blocks mod to 1.9.4, adding slopes and a variety of vanilla inspired blocks that support covers, side covers, overlays, dyes and chiseled patterns.

This is a complete rewrite, however, this mod is based on the idea and uses the textures from [Mineshopper's original mod](https://github.com/Mineshopper).
